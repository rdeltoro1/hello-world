# hello-world
Hello. My name is Roy Del Toro and I am twenty-one years old. I am third year electrical engineer major.
I was born in Orange County, California but I am 100% Mexican.
Before this pandemic, I liked to hang out with friends and go out dancing in Tijuana, Mexico on Saturday nights.
What I have being doing for fun has been tanning, yoga, bodyweight workouts, and night walks.
